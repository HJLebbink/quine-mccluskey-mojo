Quine McCluskey Petrick implementation in Modular Mojo




Petrick's method is a technique used in the field of combinatorial design theory, specifically for solving cyclic covering problems. It is employed to find a minimal set of constraints that cover all the points in a design exactly once in a cyclic manner.
